# isingModel

Solution of multi-dimensional ising Models using Julia
 
 ## Requirements

This simulation requires a well built, functioning installation of the Julia Programming Language.

It also requires the following Julia packages installed and functioning:

* Plots
* PlotlyJS
* Rsvg
* ArgParse

## Running

All code is contained in the 'src' folder. To run the simulation from a terminal, go to that directory and execute in a terminal any of the `.jl` files that begin with `run`. For example

```bash

home/isingModel$ cd src
home/isingModel/src$ julia runMetropolis.jl
```
